# Docker bash

Since i don't remember docker container id's that well and i don't want to run a bunch of commands to get there i've created this simple script to get you quick and easy to the command line of any docker container.

## Use/install

Clone the repository or copy the contents of the `dbash` file to any local file.
Copy it to any directory in your root. I suggest `/usr/bin`
